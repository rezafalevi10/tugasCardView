    <string name="article_text">In a vault deep inside Abbey Road Studios in London — protected by an unmarked, triple-locked, police-alarmed door — are something
        like 400 hours of unreleased Beatles recordings, starting from June 2, 1962 and ending with the very last tracks recorded for the Let It Be album. The best
        of the best were released by Apple Records in the form of the 3-volume Anthology series. For more information, see the Beatles Time Capsule at www.rockument.com.
        \n\n This volume starts with the first new Beatle song, “Free as a Bird”</string>
